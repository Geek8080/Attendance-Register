# Attendance-Register
Attendance management application to see the attendance status and suggest on how many classes to attend to maintain 75% attendance.


The application was developed using javafx as front-end and CSS for designing, and java for back-end. Instead of using database to store information file storage was used to just store the state of required objects through object serialisation.

The pin to start the application is 1024. The program is hard coded for the subjects that were included in my semester as this was intended for personal use only. The application uses Java SE 8U172. The installer for the application is also included in the bundles folder. To use the application just install it. The JRE required is also bundled into the application.
